# Beauty Advisor Chat Widget

This widget allows you to easily add the Beauty Advisor chatbot to any website. The widget appears as a chat bubble in the corner of your website that users can click to interact with the AI beauty advisor.

## Quick Start

<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
